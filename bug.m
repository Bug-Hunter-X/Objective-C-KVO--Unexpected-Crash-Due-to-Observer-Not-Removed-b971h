In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing issue can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  Specifically, if an observer is not properly removed before the observed object is deallocated, a crash can occur. This is because the observer's dealloc method might attempt to access the already-deallocated observed object, leading to a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyObservedObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *observedProperty;
@end

@implementation MyObservedObject
// ...
@end

@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... access observedProperty ...
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [super dealloc]; //Important for old versions. If you are using ARC, you don't need this line.
}
@end

//In some other class
MyObservedObject *obj = [[MyObservedObject alloc] init];
MyObserver *observer = [[MyObserver alloc] init];
[obj addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@
